# My CodeArchive  
Welcome to my code collection, a growing archive of small but meaningful projects I built while sharpening my programming skills. Each project here was done with the goal of learning by doingâ€”experimenting with different programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, and best practices.

Most of these projects run in the terminal, to keep things simple.

This repository serves as a journal of my coding journey, where each project reflects a step toward mastering programming fundamentals and building a deeper understanding of how things work under the hood.

ðŸ“Œ Why This Exists

- To practice programming by building real-world mini-projects.
- To get a deeper underatanding about fundamental concepts like data structures, algorithms, file handling, and more.
- To have fun writing code without overcomplicating things.

## Projects  

- [Network-Testing-Tool](https://github.com/UdithaPJ/Network-Testing-Tool.git) - A Java Swing application for executing and managing network-related commands with real-time output.  
- [Pandemic-Simulation-with-Graphs](https://github.com/UdithaPJ/Pandemic-Simulation-with-Graphs.git) - A Pygame-based project that renders and animates 3D number shapes for visualization and learning.
- [3D-Animated-Number-Shapes-with-Pygame](https://github.com/UdithaPJ/3D-Animated-Number-Shapes-with-Pygame.git) - A input-driven simulation that models disease spread and visualizes statistics using dynamic graphs.
- [LMN-Banking-System](https://github.com/UdithaPJ/LMN-Banking-System.git) - A banking system project that handles account management, transactions, and financial operations securely.
- [Network-Packet-Simulation](https://github.com/UdithaPJ/Network-Packet-Simulation.git) - A network simulation tool that models packet transmission, routing, and network behavior.
